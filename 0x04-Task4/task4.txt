Create a Java class Person with the following attributes:
•	name (a string)
•	age (an integer)
•	gender (a string)
The class should have the following methods:
•	setName(String name): This method should set the name of the person.
•	setAge(int age): This method should set the age of the person.
•	setGender(String gender): This method should set the gender of the person.
•	getName(): This method should return the name of the person.
•	getAge(): This method should return the age of the person.
•	getGender(): This method should return the gender of the person.
•	Create a Java class Employee that extends the Person class and has the following additional attributes:
•	salary (a double)
•	jobTitle (a string)
The class should have the following additional methods:
•	setSalary(double salary): This method should set the salary of the employee.
•	setJobTitle(String jobTitle): This method should set the jobTitle of the employee.
•	getSalary(): This method should return the salary of the employee.
•	getJobTitle(): This method should return the jobTitle of the employee.
You should also write a Main class that creates an Employee object, sets its attributes, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.


Create a Java class Student that has the following attributes:
•	name (a string)
•	age (an integer)
•	grades (an array of doubles)
The class should have the following methods:
•	getName(): This method should return the student's name.
•	getAge(): This method should return the student's age.
•	getGrades(): This method should return the student's grades.
•	getAverage(): This method should calculate and return the student's average grade.
You should also write a Main class that creates an array of Student objects, populates it with data, and then calculates and prints out the average grade for each student.


Create a Java class Rectangle that has the following attributes:
•	width (a double)
•	height (a double)
The class should have the following methods:
•	getArea(): This method should return the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as width * height.
•	getPerimeter(): This method should return the perimeter of the rectangle, which is calculated as 2 * (width + height).
You should also write a Main class that creates two Rectangle objects, sets their width and height, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
