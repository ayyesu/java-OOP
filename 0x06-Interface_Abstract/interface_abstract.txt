Create a Java interface Shape that has the following methods:
•	double getArea(): This method should return the area of the shape.
•	double getPerimeter(): This method should return the perimeter of the shape.
Create an abstract class AbstractShape that implements the Shape interface and has the following attributes:
•	color (a string)
The class should have the following methods:
•	setColor(String color): This method should set the color of the shape.
•	getColor(): This method should return the color of the shape.
Create a class Rectangle that extends the AbstractShape class and has the following attributes:
•	width (a double)
•	height (a double)
The class should have the following methods:
•	setWidth(double width): This method should set the width of the rectangle.
•	setHeight(double height): This method should set the height of the rectangle.
•	getWidth(): This method should return the width of the rectangle.
•	getHeight(): This method should return the height of the rectangle.
•	getArea(): This method should return the area of the rectangle, which is calculated as width * height.
•	getPerimeter(): This method should return the perimeter of the rectangle, which is calculated as 2 * (width + height).
•	toString(): This method should return a string representation of the rectangle, including its width, height, color, and area and perimeter.
Create a class Circle that extends the AbstractShape class and has the following attribute:
•	radius (a double)
The class should have the following methods:
•	setRadius(double radius): This method should set the radius of the circle.
•	getRadius(): This method should return the radius of the circle.
•	getArea(): This method should return the area of the circle, which is calculated as π * radius * radius.
•	getPerimeter(): This method should return the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as 2 * π * radius.
•	toString(): This method should return a string representation of the circle, including its radius, color, and area and perimeter.
In the Main class, create two Rectangle objects and two Circle objects, set their attributes, and demonstrate the use of each of the methods.
